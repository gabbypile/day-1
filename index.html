    <h2> Biggie Smalls </h2>

   	 <p> Yeah, this album is dedicated to all the teachers
	That told me I'd never amount to nothin'
	To all the people that lived above the buildings that I was hustlin'
	In front of that called the police on me when I was just tryin'
	To make some money to feed my daughter
	To all my peoples in the struggle, you know what I'm sayin'?
	It's all good baby, baby, check it </p>

	<p>It was all a dream, I used to read Word Up magazine</p>
	<p>Salt 'n' Pepa and Heavy D up in the limousine
	Hangin' pictures on my wall
	<ELEMENT></ELEMENT>very Saturday Rap Attack, Mr. Magic, Marley Marl</p>

	<p>I let my tape rock 'til my tape popped
	Smokin' weed and bamboo, sippin' on private stock
	Way back when I had the red and black lumberjack
	With the hat to match</p>

	<p>Remember Rappin' Duke? Duh-ha, duh-ha
	You never thought that hip hop would take it this far</p>
	<p>Now I'm in the limelight 'cause I rhyme tight
	Time to get paid, blow up like the World Trade</p>

	<p>Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
	Remember when I used to eat sardines for dinner
	Peace to Ron G, Brucey B, Kid Capri
	Funkmaster Flex, Lovebug Starsky</p>

	<p>I'm blowin' up like you thought I would
	Call the crib, same number same hood, it's all good
	And if you don't know, now you know, you know</p>

	<p>You know very well who you are
	Don't let 'em hold you down, reach for the stars
	You had a goal, but not that many
	'Cause you're the only one, I'll give you good and plenty</p>

	<p>I made the change from a common thief
	To up close and personal with Robin Leach
	And I'm far from cheap, I smoke skunk with my peeps all day</p>
	<p>Spread love, it's the Brooklyn way</p>

	<p>The Moet and Alize keep me pissy, girls used to diss me
	Now they write letters 'cause they miss me
	I never thought it could happen, this rappin' stuff
	I was too used to packin' ***s and stuff</p>

	<p>Now honies play me close like butter played toast
	From the Mississippi down to the East Coast
	Condos in Queens, indo for weeks
	Sold out seats to hear Biggie Smalls speak</p>

	<p>Livin' life without fear
	Puttin' 5 karats in my baby girl's ear
	Lunches, brunches, interviews by the pool
	Considered a fool 'cause I dropped out of high school</p>


	<p>Stereotypes of a black male misunderstood
	And it's still all good
	And if you don't know, now you know, you know</p>


	<p>You know very well who you are
	Don't let 'em hold you down, reach for the stars
	You had a goal, but not that many
	'Cause you're the only one, I'll give you good and plenty</p>

	<p>Super Nintendo, Sega Genesis
	When I was dead broke, man I couldn't picture this
	50 inch screen, money green leather sofa
	Got two rides, a limousine with a chauffeur</p>

	<p>Phone bill about two G's flat
	No need to worry, my accountant handles that
	And my whole crew is loungin'
	Celebratin' every day, no more public housin'</p>

	<p>Thinkin' back on my one-room shack
	Now my mom pimps a Ac' with minks on her back
	And she loves to show me off, of course
	Smiles every time my face is up in The Source</p>

	<p>We used to fuss when the landlord dissed us
	No heat, wonder why Christmas missed us
	Birthdays was the worst days
	Now we sip champagne when we thirsty</p>

	<p>Damn right I like the life I live
	'Cause I went from negative to positive
	And it's all, it's all good
	And if you don't know, now you know, you know</p>
